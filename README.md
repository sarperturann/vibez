An emotion analysis model developed using four diverse classification methods: Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and DistilBERT. It is trained on [Emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emotion) dataset that consists of random English twitter messages which are labeled with integers from 0 to 5, each integer representing an emotion.
 

It is done as a term project for CS464 - Introduction to Machine Learning @ Bilkent University.
